title:  Emergence: When Parts Don't Know the Whole
categories: [project]
excerpt: This blog is part 1 of my personal pursuit project "Adaptive Systems"
---

Emergence occurs when local interactions among components of a system give rise to global patterns not explicitly programmed into any part.

- Weak Emergence: Predictable with enough computational effort.
- Strong Emergence: Inexplicable even in principle from underlying rules (controversial in science).

**Ingredients of Emergent Systems**

- Local Interactions: No central controller.
- Non-linearity: Small changes in input can lead to disproportionate outputs.
- Feedback Loops: positive (amplification) and negative (stabilization).
- Multiple Scales: Behavior differs dramatically across scales.

## Systems Where Emergence Rules

### 1. Flocks and Swarms

Example: Boids simulation (Reynolds, 1986)

Mechanism:

- Separation (avoid crowding)
- Alignment (steer toward average heading)
- Cohesion (move toward center of mass)
- Emergent Behavior: Flocks, V-formations, murmuration.

### 2. Neurons and the Brain

- Individual Element: A spiking neuron
- Emergent System: Consciousness, memory, thought
- Visual: Network graph of neural activation during thought vs rest.
- Surprise: No single neuron stores a thought, yet thoughts exist.

### 3. Ant Colonies and Foraging Paths

- Mechanism: Pheromone trails, simple rules of deposition and following
- Emergent Result: Optimal paths, dynamic reconfiguration

### 4. Cities as Emergent Systems

- Individual Actor: Citizen, shopkeeper, commuter
- Emergent Phenomena: Traffic flows, gentrification, informal economies
- Visual: Heatmaps of foot traffic, nightlight satellite images, urban expansion over decades.

`“Cities are not built by planners, they are grown by walkers.”`
